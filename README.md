# Jupyter Tldraw

This project brings the very good free whiteboard https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-v1 into the jupyter output.

Based on ipyreact and tldraw-v1.
Currenlty experimental.
The latest tldraw-v2 (https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) is not support because of this issue: https://github.com/kolibril13/jupyter-tldraw/issues/9

Installation:
```
python3.11 -m venv .venv
pip install jupyterlab
pip install tldraw
jupyterlab   (or alternative VS Code Jupyter Lab)
```
